# TAMUCC FALL 2017 - COSC-3324-001: Object-Oriented Programming
# Project Two
This project required an Object Oriented piece of software or game that included a GUI.
This group came up with an idea for a procedural game. 
The idea is the player gets locked into a mansion and must go through each room and pick up items to help them in their escape.
